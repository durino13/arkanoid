# Arkanoid

Since I have never created a game, I have decided to create one in javascript. It's an Arkanoid v0.1 ;) If I will find some more time, I will fix those few glitches you can find during the gameplay ;) My primary intention was to find out, how does the game work and collision work. The code surely needs to be tidier and some stuff should be refactored. Maybe, I will work on the next version someday later ;)
